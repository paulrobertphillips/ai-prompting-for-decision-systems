# Sprint Usage Guide

This repo is designed for **real sprint workflows**, not theoretical exercises.

## Suggested Sprint Cadence

### Sprint Planning
- Decision framing prompts
- Data trust review prompts

### Mid-Sprint Design
- Cleaning strategy comparison
- Feature assumption audits
- Model constraint checks

### Pre-Review / Demo
- Evaluation metric review
- Threshold policy comparison
- End-to-end design review

You do NOT need to use every prompt every sprint.

## How to Use a Prompt

1. Copy the prompt into your tool (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
2. Fill in the `[INSERT]` fields only
3. Do not modify structure unless you understand why
4. Save outputs as **intermediate artifacts**

## What This Prevents

- Over-automation
- Premature optimization
- Model-first thinking
- Silent failure accumulation
