# Decision-First Prompt Library

This repository contains a personal prompt library designed to mirror the
**Data Science Foundations for AI-Driven Systems** curriculum.

## Purpose

These prompts are designed to:
- support decision-first data science
- constrain AI roles responsibly
- surface assumptions and risks early
- prevent over-automation
- enable safe human–AI collaboration

This is not a collection of “clever prompts”.
It is a **thinking system**.

## How This Repo Is Organized

Each folder corresponds to a stage in the data science pipeline:
1. Decision framing
2. Data trust
3. Uncertainty shaping
4. Representation
5. Modeling constraints
6. Evaluation & thresholds
7. Human–AI collaboration
8. End-to-end diagnostics

## How to Use

- Use prompts during sprint planning and design
- Copy prompts into Jira / Notion / tickets
- Modify context fields, not structure
- Keep AI in analyst or reviewer roles by default

## Guiding Principle

> AI proposes and critiques.
> Humans decide and own consequences.

## When Not to Use AI

- Final decision approval
- Threshold selection without human review
- Production readiness sign-off

This repo should evolve as your judgment evolves.
